    <h3>Black panther</h3>
    <p>
        As the historic first black superhero, Black Panther is for comic-book characters what Jackie Robinson was for
        baseball. Interestingly, 42 actor Chadwick Boseman portrayed both men. There’s zero question that T’Challa is
        a hallowed pop culture figure for people of color who felt and still feel underrepresented in genre
        storytelling.
